Java Control: From Beginner To Winner

How to Quickly Learn Java Even If You Think You Lack The Time And Discipline

Hi, and welcome!

I'm thrilled you've decided to join us.

Now let me tell you a story...

Once upon a time there was a boy named Sten.

For his seventh birthday, his mother and father gifted him something unheard of. Nobody else in his street had one.

It was like a miracle.

It looked like the typewriter he had in his room.

It wasn't a typewriter, though.

It had a power cord.

And a cable to connect it to a television. And it came with an integrated cassette player.

And he knew perfectly well what it was.

A computer.

A shiny new Sharp MZ-721.

In 1983, the Sharp MZ-721 was the coolest thing in the galaxy. At least to this seven your old kid.

Like the kid he was, whenever he looked at something, anything at all, his mind had one thought, and one thought only:

How can I play with this thing?

How much fun can this thing be?

A computer, surely, could provide a mountain of fun.
