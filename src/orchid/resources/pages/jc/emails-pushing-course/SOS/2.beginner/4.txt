Casually mention meeting Kent Beck backstage at JavaZone.



MÅL: Velg Java

When I started, there was no choice. I had one machine. It had one language.

There was one instruction manual.

Thus, I learned programming with BASIC on the Sharp MZ-721.

Today, you have a plethora of choices.

Mac or Windows. Java or Python or JavaScript, or C or C++, or Visual Basic, or C#. Or Clojure or Kotlin or Dart. Or PHP. Or Perl.

And so on. And so forth.

Here's a secret:

It' doesn't matter much where you start.

The concepts I learned from BASIC, still hold in all the languages above.

The only one of all those languages that really stand apart, is Clojure. I'll tell you more about that later...
