When I grew up, my dad was a graphic designer. But before he became a graphic designer, he had been a svakstrømselektriker.

So he was always very fascinated with electronics and computers.

I remember he created this systems where or phones started ringing whenever someone pressed our door bell.

And once, he created a tv-spill out of my grandparents' old television.

I still don't know how he did that.

These days, I'm teaching my kids to create a game of pacman that makes the lights in their rooms start blinking when they eat the pill.

I guess I'm a lot like my dad that way ... fascinated by the logic of electronics and programming, and by that making stuff happen in the real world.





Here's the secret:

You have to fall in love with programming.

You can have all the external motivation in the world...

It will only take you that far.

Those who succeed, are the ones who fall head-over-heals in love with the process.

Only they will endure the pain.

The pain that comes from searching for a bug for hours, not being able to crush it.

The acronym: Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.

BASIC.
