When I grew up, my dad was a graphic designer. But before he became a graphic designer, he had been a svakstrømselektriker.

So he was always very fascinated with electronics and computers.

I remember he created this systems where or phones started ringing whenever someone pressed our door bell.

And once, he created a tv-spill out of my grandparents' old television.

I still don't know how he did that.

These days, I'm teaching my kids to create a game of pacman that makes the lights in their rooms start blinking when they eat the pill.

I guess I'm a lot like my dad that way ... fascinated by the logic of electronics and programming, and by that making stuff happen in the real world.
