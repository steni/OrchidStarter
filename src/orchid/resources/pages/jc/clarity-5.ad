ðŸ™‚ That's a great question, and it's a privilege to try to answer it. Until recently, I thought my first focus had to be on getting my time back ... on making enough to be able to quit my job (again). But I've just realised that, even though I'v been programming since I was like 7, I'm not confident in teaching it ... and that I'm not sure about selling a "master class in Java" for $2000 ... So I'm starting with an "Introductory Java Course" in the $100-$200 range. I'll use the feedback from that to create my "signature course" / "master class". ... And by then, hopefully, I will be my own master again. And I envision a future in which I get to teach programming and instil som values into budding programmers ... to do good with their new-found super power (because it truly can be a super power). I want to connect great programmers I teach to great companies, and I want to enable these programmers to create their own, great companies. I want to build a "online course empire", and also be able to do programming myself ... To play, learn, and teach.
