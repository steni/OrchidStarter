Programming is not so much about the language, as it is about clear thinking, problem solving,
and to endure standing strong in your own uncertainty

The language is the tool -- the hammer, and you are the driving force, the hammerer ... and so
the tool is actually pretty simple, compared to knowing how to use it with nails and planks to
build a  house.

It's an almost magical tool though, giving you super powers, as it enables you to take your
thoughts and create reality.
