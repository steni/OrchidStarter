= CTA SLIDE

Bonus Tip: Buttons with text that says "Order Now" have recently been tested against more specific 'contextual' text on buttons, and the contextual buttons are winning. For example, "Order Now" is not really contextual, while, "Yes, Give Me PRODUCT With My Discount!" is very contextual. Experiment with the text on your order buttons. You can see upwards of two times the number of clicks according to the most recent tests we've ran! Also, always include a hyperlink underneath your order buttons that simply says "Order Now!" Believe it or not, about 20-30% of users will click that link and never even notice the button!
