code that kills

my kids keep harassing me about re-making this game i created as a teenager, on my Amiga 500 (hand drawn horrbile images was part of what made it so releaxed and cool)




langt uti ....
Growing up we only had one norwegian tv channel ... the swedes had two, so we watched, and learned..

this days, my kids don't understand swedish

but learning more langauges gives you a depth and breadt .
